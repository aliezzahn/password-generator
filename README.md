## Tech Stack

**Enviroment Manager:** Pipenv

## Installation

Install password-generator with **pipenv**

- **Install Pipenv**

_It is recommended that users on most platforms should install pipenv from pypi.org using:_

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

- **Isolated Installation of Pipenv with Pipx**
  _Pipx is a tool to help you install and run end-user applications written in Python. It installs applications into an
  isolated and clean environment on their own. To install pipx, just run:_

```bash
pip install --user pipx
```

_Once you have pipx ready on your system, continue to install Pipenv:_

```bash
pipx install pipenv
```

- **Pragmatic Installation of Pipenv**
  _If you have a working installation of pip, and maintain certain “tool-chain” type Python modules as global utilities
  in your user environment, pip user installs allow for installation into your home directory. Note that due to
  interaction between dependencies, you should limit tools installed in this way to basic building blocks for a Python
  workflow like virtualenv, pipenv, tox, and similar software.
  To install:_

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
```

- **Crude Installation of Pipenv**
  _If you don’t even have pip installed, you can use this crude installation method, which will bootstrap your whole
  system:_

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pypa/pipenv/master/get-pipenv.py | python
```

## Usage/Examples

```javascript
pipenv
shell
python
password_generator.py
```
